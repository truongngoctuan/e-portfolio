## Currently Tinkering With

### [EInkGames](https://truongngoctuan.github.io/eink-games)

I've used devices like Kindle Whitepaper for years now, but I wanted to experiment and see how using Kindle for other puprpose. So far has been good when I want to step away from technology and just be able to consume Kindle books without distraction.

This project is about buidling a web application for Kindle to help users interact with simple services such as taking notes. The application is built using ReactJS, Redux, and Next.js.
The current state of the project is tested in the Kindle browser with a simple Sudoku to attract users to use the application, and I am planning to add more features such as Notion and Pocket integration.

### [Sanctuary Store](https://sanctuarystore.co.nz/)

Sanctuary Store is a New Zealand-based online store that sells organic and natural products. The website is built using React, Redux, and Next.js. This is a simple e-commerce website that I have change to work with, initially as a volunteer and then as a contractor. The website is built using React, Material UI, and Next.js with integration with Shopify and Strapi CMS.

### Editing technical documentation

Last year, I was involved in a project to edit technical documentation for a company. The tasks included to check for typos, gammar, and formating errors. I also had to ensure that the documentation was clear and easy to understand for the target audience.

To optimize the process, I wrote a script to automate the process of checking for typos using **regular expressions**. This simple trick saved me a lot of time and effort. I used C# for this task.
